An analysis of Toronto's residential real estate market from 2011-2016

To conduct this analysis I leveraged census data from the city of Toronto. I used pandas functionality to read the csv formatted data and built dataframes with it as well. The dataframes allowed for an in depth analysis of various aspects of the residential real estate market, such as inventory analysis and cost analysis. To top it off, I leveraged visualization libraries such as plotly, hvplot and panel in order to create visual representations that makes it easier and more enjoyable to the reader to review the various insights that were uncovered in the analysis.
